Toy Car
===

This toy car has unrealistic physics. This allows the car to stop and reverse more quickly than a realistic car. It gives the car a more arcade-like feeling.

The car is unfinished. For example, the script requires game objects representing the wheels to be manually positioned where the model's wheels are, however, the wheels don't actually do anything yet. Take a look at the screenshot of the wireframe with wheels. This wireframe is supposed to flex whenever the wheels hit bumps in the road in order to act as a suspension.
